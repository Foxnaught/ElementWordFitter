# ElementWordFitter
Takes a list of words and tries to spell them with the elemental symbols from the periodic table of elements.

Place a list of words in words.txt in the same directory as the executable and it will print out a list of words from that list that are capable of being spelled using symbols from the periodic table of elements. It will attempt to spell each word as many different ways as possible and if there are no combinations it will simply not be printed.
